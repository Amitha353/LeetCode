1. Packaging Autotmation: number of items important? for instance consider [1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1];
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 11]
Total items: 22

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  : 45// ideally the maximum number of items the last package can have is 9, but since to reach count you will need 45 items, what will happen if there are insufficient items.
