Count Teams

An Amazon Area /manager is trying to assemble a specialized team from a roster of available 

associated. There is a minimum number of associates to be involved, and each associate needs to 
have a skill rating within a certain range. Given a list of associated' skill levels with desired
upper and lower bounds, determine how many teams can be created from the list.

Write an algorithm to find the number of teams that can be created fullfillinf the criteria.

Input:
The input to the function/method consists of five arguments:
- num, an integer representing the number of associates;
- skills, a list of integers representing the skill levels of associates.
- minAssociates, an integer representing the minimum number of ream members requires.
- minLevel, an integer representing the lower limit for skill level, inclusive.
- maxLevel, an inetger representing the upper limit for skill level, inclusive.

Output:
- Return an integer representing the total number of teams that can be formed per criteria.

Constraints:
 1 <= num <= 20
 1 <= minAssociates <= num
 1 <= minLevel <= maxLevel <= 1000
 1 <= skill[i] <= 1000
 0 <= i < num
 
 Example
 Input:
 num = 6
 skills = [12, 4, 6, 13, 5, 10]
 minAssociates = 3
 minLevel = 4
 maxLevel = 10
 
 Output:
 5
 
 Explanation:
 The list includes associates with skill levels [12, 4, 6, 13, 5, 10]. They want to hire at least 3 associates with skill level between 4 and 10, inclusive.
Four of the associates with the following skill levels {4, 6, 5, 10} meet the criteria.
There are 5 ways to form a team of 3 associates:
{4, 5, 6} , {4, 6, 10}, {4, 5, 10}, {5, 6, 10} and {4, 5, 6, 10}

         int minAssociates = 3;
         int minLevel = 4;
         int maxLevel = 10;
         int result = countTeams(num, skills, minAssociates, minLevel, maxLevel);
         System.out.println(result);

             if(skills[i] >= minLevel && skills[i] <= maxLevel) {
                 skillMet++;
             }
         }
         
         return binomialCoeff(skillMet, minAssociates);
     }
     
    static int binomialCoeff(int n, int k)
    {
        int C[] = new int[n + 1];
 
        C[0] = 1;
 
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		    C[i]=C[i-1]*(n-i+1)/i;
        }   
        
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = k; i <=n; i++) {
            result += C[i];
