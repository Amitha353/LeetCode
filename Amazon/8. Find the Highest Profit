A company has several suppliers for its products. For each of the products, the stock is represented
by a list of a number of items for each supplier. As items are purchased, the supplier raises the 
price by 1 per item purchased. Let's assume the company profit on any single item is the same as the
number of items the supplier has left. For example, if a supplier has 4 items, the profit on the
first item sold is 4, then 3, then 2 and the profit of the last one is 1.

Given a list where each value in the list is the number of the item at a given supplier and also 
given the number of items to be ordered, write an algorithm to find the highest profit that can be 
generated for the given product.

Input
The input to the function/method consists on three arguments:
- numSuppliers, an integer representing the number of suppliers;
- inventory, a list of long integers representing the value of the item at a given supplier;
- order, a long integer representing the number of items to be ordered.

Output
-Return a long integer representing the highest profit that can be generated for the given product.

Constraints

1 <= numSuppliers <= 10^5
1 <= inventory[i] <= 10 ^ 5
0 <= i < numSuppliers
1 <= orders <= sum of inventory

Example1

Input:
numSuppliers = 2
inventory = [3,5]
order = 6

Output:
19

Explanation: There are two suppliers, one with inventory 3 and the other with inventory 5,
and 6 items were ordered The maximum profit is made by selling 1 for 5, 1 for 4, and 2 at 3 and 
2 at 2 units profit. The two suppliers are left with a unit of product each. 
The maximum profit generated is 5 + 4 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 19.

5  4  3  2  1 (Price)  	   	   	   
 	 	 	  	  
1  2  4  6     (Count)

Maximizing profit: Green represents units purchased by the marketer, Red squares are products 
retained by the suppliers. Blue squares are empty.

 

Example2

Input:
numSuppliers = 2
inventory = [2,5]
order = 4

Output:

14
  	   	   	   	   	 	 	  	  
Inventory available from two suppliers is = [2,5] and the quantity ordered is 4. All items can be 
purchased from the second supplier to generate 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14. The same result is possible 
purchasing one unit from the first supplier instead. 

Example3

Input:
numSuppliers = 5
inventory = [2, 8, 4, 10, 6]

order = 20

Output:

110   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   
   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   
There are 5 sellers with inventory = [2, 8, 4, 10, 6] and Items ordered is 20.
The marketer will purchase items from any supplier until they have only 2 units left. 
The maximum profit generated is
10 + 9 + 2*8 + 2*7 + 3*6 + 3*5+ 4*4 + 4*3 = 10 + 9 + 16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 16 + 12 = 110
