Amazon is working on a new application for recording internal debts across teams.
This program can be used to create groups that show all records of debts between the group members.
Given the group debt records observed for this team (including the borrower name, lender name, and debt amount),
who in the group has the smallest negative balance?

Notes:
-10 is smaller that -1
If multiple people have the smallest negative balance, return the list in alphabetical order.
If nobody has a nagative balance, return the list consisting of string "Nobody has a nagative balance".

Write an algorithm to find who in the group has the smallest nagatie balance.

Input
The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:
- numRows, an integer representing the number of debt records.
- numCols, an integer representing the number of elements in debt records. It is always 3.
- debt, a list of triplets representing debtRecord consistsing of a string borrower, a string lender, 
and an integer amount, representing the debt record.

Output
Return a list of strings representing an alphabetically ordered list of members with the smallest negative balance.
If no team member has a nagative balance then return a list containing the string "Nobody has a nagative balance".

Constraints:
1 <= numRows <= 2*10^5
1 <= amount in debts <= 1000
1 <= length of borrower and lender in debts <= 20

Example:
Input:
---------------------------
borrower| lender | amount |
---------------------------
Alex    | Blake  |  2     |
---------------------------
Blake   |  Alex |   2    |
---------------------------
Casey   |  Alex  |    5   |
---------------------------
Blake   |  Casey |    7   |
---------------------------
Alex    |  Blake |    4   |
---------------------------
Alex    | Casey  |    4   |
---------------------------

Output:
["Alex", "Blake"]

Explanation:
The first, fifth, and sixth entries decrease Alex's balance because Alex is a borrower
The second and third entries increase because Alex is a lender. So, Alex's balance is (2+5) - (2+4+4) = 7 - 10 = -3.
Blake is lender is the first and fifth entries and borrower in second and fourth entries. Thus, Blakes balance is (2+4)-(2+7) = 6 - 9 = -3.
Casey is a borrower in the third entry and lender in the fourth and sixth entries. Thus casey's balance
(7+4)-5 = 11 - 6 = 6.
Here Alex and Blake both have the balance of -3, which is the minimum amoung all members.
